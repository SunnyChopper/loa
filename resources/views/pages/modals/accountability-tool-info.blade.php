					<p>I put out an Instagram Story asking you guys what things you were struggling with and needed help on. The majority of people responded that they were having trouble staying on track.</p>
					<p>So I had an idea that would help Wolf Squad move forward. This software will be the result.</p>
					<p>I learned that having others hold you accountable is extremely valuable. You can easily give yourself an excuse for not doing something, however, others won't let that slide so easily.</p>
					<p>One of the nice things about this software will be that the more tasks you accomplish, the more points you will get.</p>
					<p>These points can be used in the Ambition Shop. You can get discounts on products (shirts, sweatshirts, etc.) and services (marketing funnel design, website consulting, etc.) and if you have enough points, you can get services for absolutely free!</p>
					<p>So not only will you be getting more things done and staying on track, you'll get rewarded with real life valuable services.</p>
